This is a full-stack web application created on the front-end with **_Nuxtjs_**, a **_Vuejs_** framework for server-side rendering, and **_Tailwind CSS_** for the styling.

> You can check the source code for the front-end [HERE](https://github.com/rafamedtech/workout_tracker)

When it comes to the back-end I used the **_Django Rest Framework_** along with **_Postgres_** for the database and **JWT** for authentication.

The project is hosted in **Netlify** for the Nuxtjs static site and **Heroku** for the Rest API and the Postgres database.
